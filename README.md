# flightsounds
## Overview
The script [**`flight_event_extractor.py`**](https://github.com/dan-walsh/flightsounds/blob/master/flight_event_extractor.py), which runs in a [Python 2.7, 32-bit environment with `arcpy`](https://github.com/dan-walsh/flightsounds/blob/master/python2-arcpyenv.yml),  is designed to calculate the time and location of the closest approach of an aircraft to a sound station. It accomplishes this by linearly interpolating (in 3 dimensions) aircraft GPS points contained within input files provided by the user. The output is a csv file containing a list of events for a given station with associated location and velocity data, as well as flight metadata.

The output csv file is used as an input to [**`Flight_Event_to_SRCID.py`**](https://github.com/dan-walsh/flightsounds/blob/master/Flight_Event_to_SRCID.py), which builds a standard NPS SRCID file of each overflight event within a given radius of the sound station. The second script runs in a [Python 3.5, 64-bit environment](https://github.com/dan-walsh/flightsounds/blob/master/python3soundDBenv.yml) with NPS libraries [`iyore`](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/iyore) and [`soundDB`](https://github.com/dbetchkal/soundDB) installed.

The resulting SRCID file contains a list of events with reference numbers. When opened in SPLAT, each calculated aircraft approach for a given site will appear as a 1-minute rectangle centered on the event. The user must then manually re-annotate each event to it's correct duration using the reference number as a source ID. The events can then be joined back to the overflights data using [**`SPLAT_append.py`**](), which joins the original csv flight event file to annotation results.

## Required Inputs and Outputs:

The input and output file names can be specified when running the scripts; standardized names are suggested for consistency.

### Input files:
    
#### allstations.shp
A file with zpoints describing the location of the sound stations (elevation in meters.) Must include following fields: <br>
> code - contains the four digit site code <br>
> elevation - contains the elevation of the sound station in meters
    
#### flight_pts.shp
A file containing GPS data points describing the flight. Must include z-data in meters. Must include the following fields:
> altitude - contains the absolute MSL altitude of the plane at each point (int) <br>
> ltime - contains the local time at which the point was recorded in the format "%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S" <br>
> desc_ - contains a string with a unique flight identifier code 
    
#### flight_lines.shp

A file containing lines generated by interpolating the points of each given flight. Must contain z data in meters. Must include the following fields: 
> desc_ - the unique flight identifier, matched to the identifiers in the flight_pts file (string)


### Output Files
By default, output files are named SITE_overflights.csv, where SITE is the specific site code. They are saved directly in the selected working directory.

## Running the Scripts

### flight_event_extractor

*Note: This script **must run in a python 2.x environment on a computer running arcmap**. A yml file for building such an environment, named python2-arcpyenv.yml, can be found in this repository. To create the environment using Anaconda, download the yml file and then type the following into the console:*

```
>conda env create -f "path to python2-arcpyenv.yml"
>activate soundDB
```

*If the version of arcmap is different than Desktop 10.5, the following lines in the script need to be changed to reflect the right version:*
```
sys.path.append(r"C:\Program Files (x86)\ArcGIS\Desktop10.5\arcpy")
sys.path.append(r"C:\Program Files (x86)\ArcGIS\Desktop10.5\bin")
```

The ultimate goal of the first two scripts is to create two files: a SRCID file containing predicted overflight events, and an overflights output file containing detailed information about the location and velocity of the plane at the time of closest approach.

To run the **`flight_event_extractor.py`** script, place the input shapefiles (*allstations.shp*, *flight_pts.shp*, and *flight_lines.shp*) into a single folder. The script will prompt the user to enter the path to this working directory when it is run. If the file names are changed the names entered in the script will need to be changed as well.

The script requires two additional inputs from the user: 

#### flight search radius 
The radius outward from the sound station within which flights will be assessed for point of closest approach (measured in meters). Values below 5000 meters are not reccomended as planes frequently travel these distances during the interval between points, meaning it is unlikely the script will have the two points it needs to calculate the closest approach.

#### station code 
The four character alpha site code of the sound station you would like to calculate the closest approach to.

### Flight_Event_to_SRCID

*Note: This script **must run in a python 3.x environment**. A yml file for building such an environment, named python3soundDBenv.yml, can be found in this repository. To create the environment using Anaconda, download the yml file and then type the following into the console:*

```
>conda env create -f "path to python3soundDBenv.yml"
>activate soundDB
```

This script takes the output of the flight_event_extractor, eliminates all closest approach events that do not have matching data in the sound database (accessed with `soundDB`), and saves the remaining events in SRCID format, allowing them to be manually annotated in SPLAT. The output is saved in the selected working directory as *SRCID_DENASITE.txt*, where SITE is the station code for the sound station under consideration. 

### Splatting the Events

The output of **`Flight_Event_to_SRCID.py`** is a SRCID file, and should be placed in the /users/USERNAME/My Documents/ToolboxOutput so that SPLAT will display the events when the correct hourly NVSPL file is loaded.

The resulting events are represented by the narrow rectangles in the image below. The rectangles are centered around the time at which we would expect the flight to make its closest approach to the sound station. They are characterized in the SRCID file as having been annotated by user EXTRACTOR. The sound metric values all have dummy variables. The wide rectangles represent the exact same event, but annotated by the user based on the initial event. Each event is assigned a reference number by the script; **that same number must be used as a source ID when annotating the event in SPLAT**.

## Geometric Calculations Diagram
Because the overflight GPS tracks are made up of straight line segments that always start and end at a GPS point, we can interpolate between the GPS points using simple trigonometric equations. All results are based on linear interpolations, which work in almost all cases; if a plane makes a very sharp turn and has a long GPS interval, it is possible that the straight line connecting the two points will be a considerable distance from the plane's actual location at that time. This problem can only be corrected by acquiring more closely spaced GPS data.

The closest distance to the sound station is calculated in three dimensions using arcpy's `near3d` tool. The fraction of the distance covered between the points at closest approach is used to interpolate average airspeed, climb/descent rate, and other factors.

Theta is the vector of the flight, measured as a compass bearing clockwise from north.
